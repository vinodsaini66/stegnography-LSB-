To achieve a high embedding e?ciency which indicates the average bit number of embedded secret data per change, 
the ordered triple (1,7,3) is used in our scheme as an example of matrix encoding. Accordingly, 
the structure of the four-pixel block in the cover image of previous schemes also needs to be changed.
In the proposed scheme, as shown in Figure 5, every three pixels form a block so as to implement the matrix encoding.
 Suppose that we choose m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6,m7 from the three pixels ˆ X, ˆ V , ˆ W in each block as an embedding cell. 
And each shadow pixel is converted into binary bits s1,s2,s3 as secret data to be embedded. 
The following is a basic algorithm that reveals the principle of the proposed scheme for embedding.
